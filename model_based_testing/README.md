### Purpose of MBT
In unit testing, the programmer codes the test cases, and also codes
assertions that check whether each test case passed. In model-based testing,
the programmer codes a "model" that generates as many test cases as desired
and also acts as the oracle that checks the cases. Model-based testing is
recommended where so many test cases are needed that it is not feasible to
code them all by hand
