### Purpose of MBT
In unit testing, the programmer codes the test cases, and also codes
assertions that check whether each test case passed. In model-based testing,
the programmer codes a "model" that generates as many test cases as desired
and also acts as the oracle that checks the cases. Model-based testing is
recommended where so many test cases are needed that it is not feasible to
code them all by hand


 ### Why Use Model-Based Testing Instead of Automated Regression Tests?

**1. Dynamic Test Case Generation:**
Model-based testing generates test cases dynamically based on a model of the system. This ensures a broader exploration of the system's behavior compared to static automated regression tests, which rely on predefined and unchanging test cases.

**2. Adaptability to System Changes:**
When a system evolves, the model in model-based testing can be updated to reflect these changes, and new test cases can be generated automatically. This adaptability keeps the testing process current and effective without extensive manual updates.

**3. Increased Coverage:**
Models can represent various states and transitions of a system, allowing model-based testing to cover a wider range of functional paths and conditions. Static tests might miss some scenarios due to their fixed nature.

**4. Efficiency in Test Maintenance:**
Maintaining a large suite of static regression tests can be labor-intensive and error-prone. Model-based testing reduces this burden as updating the model and regenerating test cases is typically more efficient than manually updating each static test case.

**5. Early Detection of Defects:**
Model-based testing can identify defects earlier in the development process by generating test cases that explore different paths and conditions. Static regression tests may only detect issues within their limited predefined scenarios.

**6. Comprehensive and Automated Testing:**
In practice, model-based testing allows for automated, efficient, and comprehensive testing, improving coverage and relevance of tests. It significantly reduces the time and effort required for test maintenance compared to traditional static automated regression testing.
Conclusion:
Using model-based testing over traditional automated regression tests ensures a more adaptable, efficient, and comprehensive testing process. It dynamically generates relevant test cases, adapts easily to system changes, covers a broader range of scenarios, and reduces maintenance efforts, leading to earlier defect detection and overall higher quality assurance.

#### Potential Problems in ROI Calculation:
Several potential problems can arise (with model-based testing) in the ROI calculation:

**1. Initial Setup Costs:**
The initial setup costs for model-based testing, including tool acquisition, model development, and staff training, can be high and might be underestimated.

**2. Maintenance Efforts:**
The ongoing effort required to maintain and update the models and test cases can be significant. If these efforts are not accurately accounted for, the ROI calculation may be overly optimistic.

**3. Complexity of Models:**
The complexity of the models and the system under test can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of model-based testing. Complex systems may require more detailed and extensive models, increasing the initial and ongoing costs.

**4. Learning Curve:**
There is often a learning curve associated with adopting new testing methodologies and tools. The time and resources needed for training and adaptation can impact the short-term ROI.

**5. Realistic Savings Estimates:**
Estimating the savings from reduced manual testing and increased defect detection accuracy can be challenging. If these savings are overestimated, the ROI may not be as favorable as projected.

**6. Scalability:**
The scalability of the model-based approach may vary depending on the system's size and complexity. Larger or more complex systems may require more substantial investment in model creation and maintenance.
