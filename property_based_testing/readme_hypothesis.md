Think of a normal unit test as being something like the following:
    - Set up some data.
    - Perform some operations on the data.
    - Assert something about the result.

**Hypothesis** lets you write tests which instead look like this:
    - For all data matching some specification.
    - Perform some operations on the data.
    - Assert something about the result.
